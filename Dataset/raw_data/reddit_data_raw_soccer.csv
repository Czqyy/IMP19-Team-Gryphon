Stop spreading this rumor. It's irresponsible.

GasolinePizza,Berly653,"I disagree (admittedly as an American, but one with many Jewish friends and that has very much been invested in this conflict for them and their friends' sake)

Trump did the Jerusalem recognition but other than that he was 100% opposed to supporting any partners or allies. If shit went down and Israel ended up in open conflict with Iran, there's no way that Trump would be willing to commit any resources in support.

The only pro-Israel moves he ever made were the ones that didn't cost him anything, and he made it very clear that he's not a fan of supporting other countries.

The only potential avenue for Trump directly supporting Israel would be because he and Iran hate each other. That could lead to direct support in an all out war, but it's still an unstable gamble given that his position constantly switches week by week.",2024-10-19 21:01:19
