o_portista,1DMod,"Time flies, It's been over a day now with Liams Passing, and it's still as unbelievable as when it was still announced. Who would of thought we'd see a One Direction member passing so early, espically in our 20s.

Regardless, if you weren't a fan of One Direction, one way or another, if you were alive during their prime era you couldn't avoid them, and had to admit they were a phenomenal, and for a majority of us, it feels as if a piece of our childhoods went with him. I'm a guy, and I remember when I would go out with friends, their music would be all over the radio, TVs, and everyone had a positive view, even guys, who at the time, was sorta embarrassing to be a fan of theirs in public, and I can't think of anyone, or anything as popular, or had such a unique influence like they did during that era.

For some they are only finding about them now because of his passing, but I can't be the only one that truly wishes we could go back to those days, and nothing in today, can ever be as close as those times.

Liam obviously had issues, and One Direction alongside espically behind the scenes, and no matter what, we can all agree Liam deserved better, and needed help, and it's always when it's late we value these things, and how short life is, and his death, truly opened the eyes to many. One Direction to some at the time could of been a fad, but to many only now they realize, how it wasn't, and how much they truly valued those times. Despite the band ending years ago, yesterday, was the real ending, and it'll never truly be the same, an end of an era.

Wishing nothing but peace to Liam's friends, family at this time, and us fans who took it too heart deeply.

Originally was going to post it as my own post in the subreddit, but was told to post it here instead, truly great.

Stumbled across something today

Liam was always so active with Directioners and had done multiple following sprees way back when. I remember SCREAMING my head off when I saw that he had followed me. It was during a very tough time in my life and was one of the few moments where I felt genuinely happy. I would often DM him when I needed someone to turn to throughout the years. While I never got a reply back, it always made me feel like someone was out there who cared. I‚Äôm in my late 20‚Äôs now and have really been struggling with the recent news. But I‚Äôll always cherish this little connection we had üíî",2024-10-18 17:03:30
somyoshino,1DMod,"I originally made this as a post, but here it is as a comment to lighten the mods‚Äô burden.

To my fellow survivors:

You are not an abuse apologist.

If you are expressing your love for the Liam you once knew and wishing he has peace, it does not make you a bad person.

Regardless of what anyone says, even if you express kindness and compassion for someone who did terrible things, you are a real victim and your feelings, whether they are anger or sorrow or happiness, are yours and they are true.

I don't know if this post will be taken down and am trying to avoid using language that may be triggering, but I need you to know this.

I am both a DV survivor who experienced some of the same things as his victims and former Liam girl who had the privilege to work with his team many years ago, and my feelings are endlessly complex and not helped by the insistence some people have that if you are a survivor the only feelings you should have about him are negative and you should only focus on his victims.

We were all there to know that he was once a good person who did and still does good things. We know that he was not born evil. Of course we wish to remember him that way. Of course his bandmates want to remember him that way.

You are a human being, and you are not like the people who hurt and doubted you when you came forward just because you still have love and hope in your heart. You are not making things worse for other survivors. I promise you that.¬†

I have all the love in the world for you and wish you the peace you deserve.¬†",2024-10-18 17:03:30
dagummiie,1DMod,"The last few days have been nothing short of an odd, emotional blur trying to process that Liam is gone. I feel like I'm on the same boat as most of you where 1D once consumed my life in my teenage years--they brought me purpose and community, and they were my reason to look forward to the next day during that period of my life. They made such an impact on so many of us, and though I admittedly did not keep up much since the split, I never stopped wishing the best for them. I only thought fondly of those years. I fully expected they would grow old with us, and maybe we would eventually get to see a 1D reunion take place.

I've been spending a lot of time reading through everyone's thoughts here--I once again feel this nostalgic need for an online community and safe space, just like we had all those years ago. But also, I've been surprised with how much this has been popping up in parts of my life I just didn't expect: People talking about it at work, also openly mourning, and hearing neighbors at my apartment playing Liam's songs in their car as they drive by. Also, having family or friends reach out because they remember how much I loved 1D (thinking about how their first thought of the news was to reach out to me feels so odd, but also I get it). 

It all makes me feel mixed emotions: proud at the reminder of Liam's impact, but also sad and frustrated that it took a tragedy for all the love to come out when it could have been communicated when he was still here. But I know that's just how life works. Even I was far disconnected with the fandom and their lives until this happened. I feel like we can only use this as a reminder to reach out to our loved ones often, including distant friends whom we've been meaning to talk to for some time.",2024-10-18 17:03:30

stewieswaffles,1DMod,"Mourning Liam: A Reflection

I‚Äôve been mourning. Two long, hard days have passed and I am deeply sad in ways that I can‚Äôt seem to justify nor fix. 

I‚Äôve been remembering. We all have our reasons and attachments that come with the love of this band. For me, my memories of One Direction are the happiest days of my extremely difficult girlhood amidst divorce and school bullying. But One Direction‚Äîmy enthusiasm for their videos and personalities, and the time I spent with friends watching the movie and gushing about our favorites‚Äîthat is what kept me just the slightest bit present and engaged in the world. 

My dream was and always will be to meet them, tell them what it is that they have done for me. At the very least, I was itching to see them in concert. But, I was too young and too broke. I never got to see One Direction in person or give them my best wishes. Some part of me was hoping that someday a reunion would come, and my presence in a cheering stadium would tell each member how much I cherished them and how much they impacted my small world. For days I‚Äôve been mourning that this dream and hope can never be fully realized. My favorite member, Liam, would never know that he and his bandmates saved my life in many ways. 


But in my reflection I have also realized that perhaps now, more than ever, Liam can see the fans that maybe he didn‚Äôt even know he had. Zayn said in his message, ‚ÄúI have found myself talking out loud to you, hoping you could hear me.‚Äù This has been the comforting reminder that I didn‚Äôt realize I needed. My challenge and permission to myself (and to you if you need it): tell him‚Äîcry to and about him. 

I don‚Äôt know what that looks like for you‚Äîmaybe writing a letter, singing his songs, just talking to him to share your appreciation, and memories. Somewhere, in whatever comes after this life, Liam has all the time in the world to see each of us, to hear each of us, to know that he is loved. Our grief can bring all of us, including Liam, the healing we need.

It is a precious gift to remember someone. They may not be here face to face but they will always be in your soul bringing you joy, and happiness, and everything else they made you feel. Our precious and happy memories remind us that our feelings are valid, our relationships (yes, even the parasocial ones) are sacred, and that we are not as alone as we feel. 

‚Äî

To Liam: if you‚Äôre reading this, I want to say I will always be a Liam girl and I am still grateful for all the ways your work and music has brought joy to my life. Though I wasn‚Äôt always a fan of your  actions, you deserved so much better than the messes, the mental health issues, and bad days that life gave you. I hope that wherever you are now, you can begin to feel at peace and heal years of trauma. I am so extremely grateful for all that you and this band did to make Directioners worldwide feel seen and heard. ü§ç",2024-10-18 17:03:30

Known-Amoeba6370,1DMod,"**My Thoughts on Liam's Passing**

In all honesty his death doesn't come to a shock for me. The way Liam lived was self-destructive and a cry for help. It's a tragedy. Watching back over everything it made me come to a little bit of an understanding of what was going on in his life. I always felt out of everyone in the band Liam was the most lost to me. They all had distinct personalities that set them apart, but Liam felt like he never truly had an identity. It was clear to see in the beginning of the band that Liam was ""supposed"" to be the leader. He had an amazing voice he had the textbook definition of ""perfect boy band look"" and everything. I felt like he had a lot of pressure put on him to be this person he wasn't. You could tell he was quite shy when he was young but then he turned into someone who was the complete opposite. I think this probably took a toll on him which made him into the person he became. It's hard to hear everyone tell you that you should be this way or that. I think it made him spiral into this identity crisis we saw after the band went on hiatus. While all the other members had their own successes and kind of became their own person away from one direction, I feel as if though Liam's identity was only One Direction. This past couple years we definitely saw this identity crisis come to the surface. The podcast he went on was a major red flag, and the hate he got afterwards made things worse. He became a cringe meme on TikTok for his song Strip That Down. It was sad watching him breakdown in real life. After the meme died down a little I was hopeful he was figuring himself out, He had a girlfriend, he was traveling, he seemed happy he was reconnecting back with the boys again, but then the accusations came by his ex-fianc√© (ex-girlfriend?) about him being an abuser. I don't know the full story yet but it was devastating to hear. And now he's dead. I don't think it was a suicide, I think he genuinely fell, but the drugs and the alcohol mixed together probably made him disoriented. It's nobodies fault that he died. I think this is just one of those unfortunate accidents and somebodies downfall. I hate that this is how his story ended, I wish he could be there for his son, who now lost a father. I feel that he could've changed and found himself if given the time. But we will never know :(",2024-10-18 17:03:30
Ok-Meeting-88,1DMod,"**My reflection and metaphor for this tragedy**

**This book was fresh in my mind having read it again recently**

How Orwell‚Äôs 1984 Sheds Light on the Exploitation of Liam Payne

His recent struggles in the music industry bear a striking resemblance to the dystopian themes in Orwell‚Äôs 1984. Fame, once a dream, has turned into something far more sinister, with Payne‚Äôs experience revealing how artists can become expendable in a profit-driven system.

Fans and critics often brush off celebrity issues with ‚ÄúWhat do they have to complain about?‚Äù But that mindset misses the deeper point. Much like Orwell‚Äôs totalitarian regime, the music industry is designed to keep control. It uses and discards people for profit, leaving them behind when they‚Äôre no longer useful.

In 1984, the individual is crushed for the sake of maintaining power. The same happens in music: Liam Payne, like many artists, was pushed to his limits by those profiting from him, only to be cast aside once his relevance faded. The moment he spoke out about his struggles, the industry cut him loose‚Äîjust like Orwell‚Äôs regime casts out those who threaten the status quo.

Even more tragic is the role of fans. In this analogy, they are Orwell‚Äôs ‚Äòproles‚Äô‚Äîunknowingly sustaining the system. The merchandise keeps selling, the singles keep streaming, and the industry keeps going, indifferent to the damage it causes.

Payne‚Äôs journey mirrors Winston Smith‚Äôs in 1984. He tried to push back, but found that the system is bigger than him. His experience highlights how fame can become its own Orwellian nightmare, one where profit and control are all that matter.

It‚Äôs easy to dismiss celebrities and have this idealistic picture of their life, but Payne‚Äôs story is a reminder that the machinery of fame can be destructive‚Äîand we, as fans, are often complicit in its survival.

Just my own thoughts. He deserved better than this end.

God rest your soul lad, The pain is gone and your at peace.

Take it easy folks",2024-10-18 17:03:30
Frequent_Earth2135,1DMod,"I never considered myself a fan. I listened to the first album, and the second one front to back with my sister. That's it really. I did like Liam though. I think I felt myself in him, which would only be crystallised when I watched an interview with him many years later. I moved on though. When this happened I found myself scouring for details, and losing my composure. Just a little. But when I was coming home for work, relistening to the old podcast episode I listened to way back he mentioned their last album. So, I turned it on and broke down crying at 'If I could fly'. I pulled into Woolworths and cried so much. I still don't understand my feelings, but I'm clearly upset by this. I had my own substance issues, and suicide attempts, so I can only imagine it hurts seeing someone who I could relate to go. I wish I could speak with more clarity but my feelings are something I'm seeking help to better express. I'm just really upset. They were playing a 1D song at the supermarket today.

The truth is, I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm scared, Liam.

You didn‚Äôt know me, but I loved you. With every ounce of my soul, all I felt was love for you.

Thirteen-year-old me sat on the stairs at that Christian school, listening to you. Every morning, I‚Äôd wake up, grab my earbuds, and play your songs while I got ready for school.

I remember being afraid to let people know how much I loved the band. I was scared they‚Äôd make fun of me, and I was already alone at school every day. I didn‚Äôt need more of that. But it was okay because I had you, and in some strange way, it felt like you had me too.

You saved me when I had nothing and no one. I grew up with you. I was a kid, then a teenager, and now I‚Äôm an adult. As time passed, I stopped grabbing my earbuds as often. I changed. But every once in a while, on my way to work, I‚Äôd go back to my old playlist and find you again. Your voice felt like home. You were always there for me. I always had you.

But I‚Äôm scared, Liam. Because now that you‚Äôre gone, I‚Äôve realized just how fragile life is. I took it for granted. I took you for granted. I never stopped to think that one day, you might not be there to fall back on. The thought that you were fighting your own battles while you were saving people like me‚Ä¶ it hurts. It‚Äôs terrifying.

I know I was just one person, and you had millions of fans. Billions of people who loved you. But‚Ä¶ I wish I could‚Äôve saved you like you saved me. I wish I could‚Äôve given you the same hope and strength you gave me when I was lost.",2024-10-18 17:03:30

I was unable to shed a tear when I first heard the news because I still couldn't process it at the time. It has since sunk in, and I can't stop bawling my eyes out. No one in my family loved 1D as much I did, and still do, so no one really understands my feelings about his death. As a former Liam girl, I was so violently in love with him for the majority of my childhood, but sort of stopped listening to him when the band split up, well to most of them except Niall. I did listen to most of Liam's music right after the band went on hiatus but that didn't go on for long because i just missed the boys' music together so it didn't feel right to me. I feel so devastated. I wish I could have supported and loved him a lot more while he was still alive. The illusion of time, I guess.

During the times I'm not sobbing since it sunk in that he's really gone, I find comfort in the thought that he couldn't have intentionally caused his own death, I keep thinking it has to have been an accident. It still hurts a lot, but thinking that he couldn't have chosen to go out like that calms the pain in my heart a little.

No one does but especially not someone who was as sweet as you. I wished One Direction would make the headlines again but never like this. You'll forever be 1/5 of One Direction. Rest peacefully Liam, thank you for being a part of my life.",2024-10-18 17:03:30
coraline_button_,1DMod,"I just need a place to vent and this seems like the best place. I have never been good with the idea of death. Whenever I thought of it, I would get shortness of breath and my eyes would feel prickly. I haven‚Äôt experienced someone passing who I was close with since 2013. Sure, I‚Äôve been to funerals and have cried for people I barely knew, but I‚Äôm so unwell right now. 

My Grandma passed away 6 days prior to Liam passing away. She had Alzheimer‚Äôs, so I felt like I was a little prepared. Liam was SO unexpected. 

I was a One Direction girl ever since I found them in 2010/2011. They are STILL the only music I listen to (also their solo albums). 

I feel like the combination of both losses are making life extremely hard right now. I feel like I am genuinely depressed right now. Sometimes I can‚Äôt breathe. I can burst into tears at any second. I just feel like I have to hold it in all day until I can get into the shower and cry in private. 

I feel like my husband doesn‚Äôt understand, and I am so embarrassed and just try to act like I am not horribly sad. Feels like it‚Äôs just easier to be in a shower or sleeping. 

I have to travel this upcoming week for my grandma‚Äôs funeral and I am frankly I‚Äôm not sure how to function leading up to it. 

I am not at a risk of hurting myself at all. I just feel so utterly depressed.",2024-10-18 17:03:30
Chessa_Tomlinson,1DMod,"Diana 

For me the song Diana ties a lot into how i feel right now, how i connect to Liam and his passing. I know a lot of people are connecting with Night Changes and Story of my Life. The lyrics just connect so much right now with the entire situation, his struggle, how he saved the fans, and the media aspect. What songs are you connecting to right now a lot?",2024-10-18 17:03:30
Your-mom-07,1DMod,"Idk what to do ig I just need to vent.
I‚Äôm 17 l‚Äôve been listening to one direction since I can remember my obsession kinda calmed down for a while until 2021-2022 | was obsessed w them all over again i listened to all their solo stuff all their 1D stuff they were my everything it kinda slowed down again the past year ish but i still love them so much. I don‚Äôt know what to do or how to feel about Liam. I feel so bad I laughed at stupid TTs making fun of him this past week and I was really sad and mad at him about everything that came out about him not being the greatest guy but all he needed was help and he didn‚Äôt get it. I‚Äôve been crying so much since I found out I feel numb and sad and confused and mad at myself (as I should) | feel like I‚Äôll never feel ok again ik that sounds dramatic but it‚Äôs truly how l feel I kinda wanna not be here anymore so l stop feeling this.

That was a happier time in my life and I wish his wasn't gone. Love all of you going through this, and I hope his family is doing okay through this awful time.
