M795,WorldNewsMods,"> Some said that we would last only for three days, but the third year of the war will soon be over. The plan announced by President @ZelenskyyUa summarizes the results of the summer and fall campaign of 2024 and gives Ukrainians a perspective on the possibility of its victorious conclusion in 2025. Not everyone believes it. Fatigue from human losses in #Ukraine and from economic costs among its allies make it difficult to objectively assess the status quo.

> This year, the Armed Forces of Ukraine repelled a strategic offensive in the Kharkiv region with heavy losses for the Russians, removing a direct threat to Ukraine's second most populous city. The Ukrainian offensive in the Kursk region of the Rf allowed to establish control over several dozen villages and the district center of Sudzha, disrupted enemy plans to invade the Sumy region, and forced the Russians to disperse their reserves. In heavy battles in Donbas, Ukrainian forces are implementing a defense strategy, exchanging every kilometer for hundreds of units of Russian equipment and thousands of destroyed occupiers. Gaining time, Ukraine is preparing new brigades and means to strike at military infrastructure deep in #Russia.

> Through incredible human efforts, Ukraine has managed to establish parity on the battlefield with an empire that is four times larger in population and ten times larger in economy. What's next? Defeat is out of the question. And to win, we need support that at least as good as the support that Rf receives from the countries of the anti-Western alliance. What exactly does Ukraine need and how much of it is set out in the Victory Plan.

The agreement includes a commitment to jointly produce military drones.*

*""Unarmed drones can fly long distances and for extended periods,"" the Ministry of Defense stated. “They are used to gather real-time information from the battlefield, collect intelligence, and conduct surveillance. At the same time, modern drones must have advanced technologies to remain undetectable, resist jamming, and operate autonomously if they temporarily lose contact with their base.”*

They will rock up somewhere in Ukraine thinking they're the bees knees and that Ukrainian folk are inferior people. They will have been told that NK has the best weapons and that Ukraine will basically fall any day now.

Other than my usual eye-rolling reaction to such sentiments, I always found it funny that so many people in this country seem to think of America like some sort of demigods, to be feared and hated, but also respected, as if Harris has some sort of ability to wave her hand and push half of Russia into the sea. Maybe it's just fortunate for me that I grew up in a western country before moving back to Russia as an adult, but anyway. I definitely feel that the sentiment has changed.

The major russian claims all over this years was ""we are neighbours forever, take us into account... even if we are shitting on you all the time and making harm"".

cagriuluc,Zuldak,"This is such a sad, bad take. Literally there is nothing in this comment that shows you understand what’s going on. 

Kursk offensive is not stalled, it was never meant to go up to Moscow. It was an opportunistic operation. All the land was taken in a mere week, without huge losses like the Russians do constantly with their wasteful assaults. At that point, it became a huge win for Ukraine. Now Russia needs to grind the same way just to take back their land. Defending to attire the enemy involves giving ground, that’s exactly what’s going on. 

Furthermore, Ukraine broke a huge taboo. 

Furthermore, Russia now cannot leave a huge section of the frontline like they were doing prior to Kursk, they will need to defend the whole border.

I asked the Hyundai folks about it and they said in the 80s and 90s Germany was an engineering powerhouse and German was considered the language of engineering and it was taught at the technical universities in South Korea.

Your lying about Trump's enormous popularity amongst your people is part of the problem. Your country and even SCOTUS has become fascist, Trump is a rapist, a child molester, a criminal, a mentally ill, pathological liar, a fascist, a racist and a proud treasonist. 

Him being allowed on the ticket means your justice system is a joke and you are a failed state.

You need to come out of denial, just like the Russians do. But, you obviously never will, due to belief perseverance and sunk cost fallacy/escalation of commitment. You simply cannot accept what your country and your people have become."
Glavurdan,Zuldak,"Sending those troops to Pokrovsk direction or any other part of Donbass wouldn't change anything. Only slow down the push a little bit, causing further loss of morale among Ukrainians. Donbass is the primary focus of Russia's military efforts in Ukraine, it's the tip of the knife so to speak. Just funneling soldiers there to die is the easiest way to lose manpower. Russia's advance there is inevitable as it stands either way.

What one should do in that situation is strike where the enemy is not looking, shake up the battlefield, make an unpredictable move. And while it didn't have an effect as big as some may have anticipated, it did rejuvenate an already stale war and thus made a difference."
prof_rj_gumby,SeeCrew106,"“Voters were much older, on average, than nonvoters. Adults under 50 made up 36% of voters, but 64% of nonvoters. This is very similar to the pattern seen in 2018 – although those under 50 made up a somewhat larger share of voters in 2018 (40%).
Turnout also differed by race and ethnicity.
Three-quarters of voters (75%) were White, non-Hispanic adults. But this group accounted for a smaller share (55%) of nonvoters. Hispanic adults and Black, non-Hispanic adults each made up 9% of voters, but slightly larger shares of nonvoters (18% and 15%, respectively). Asian Americans made up 3% of voters, and a slightly higher share (5%) of nonvoters. These differences are nearly identical to the patterns seen in 2018.”

https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/07/12/voter-turnout-2018-2022/

Pew research polls.  Other charts and data in the above show these demographics favoring republicans.  These are also consistent trends over time, and were when I got my degree in political science.  

I literally agree with you on almost everything except the assertion that half of Americans support that orangutan.  The majority haven’t and don’t, again born out of the statistics as well as actual historical popular vote counts.  The only reason it’s relevant is because of the peculiarities of the electoral college system. 

I, as well as the majority of Americans, want this man gone."
SeeCrew106,prof_rj_gumby,"> Pew research polls. 

You just showed Pew going over voter demographics and you then ask the reader to infer or **assume** that due to these characteristics, these must ""skew R"", which was your actual, original claim. This is statistical malpractice and ***your own source*** proves it:

> Adults who voted in at least one election during the period **divide evenly between Democrats and independents who lean toward the Democratic Party or Republicans and Republican-leaning independents in their current party affiliation (48% each).**

https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/07/12/voter-turnout-2018-2022/

> I got my degree in political science. 

And yet you keep lying about the numbers, for reasons I already explained in my previous comment.

I asked you several questions in my first comment which you conveniently ignored. I linked a poll sampling **random adults**, not ""likely voters"" in my second comment **which you, again, ignored**, and I use your **own source** which you either haven't read or think I won't read to show you not even your ""Skew R"" claim holds any water.

Tell me, if ""likely voters"" will ""skew R"", then why do Republicans keep losing the popular vote? 

Either your political science degree was of low quality, you were a poor student or you're not being honest. After three comments full of cope and mendacity, I'm going with all of the above.

The most irritating tactic is where you consistently ignore me saying ""hovering between 45% and 50%"".

You are in denial. You are openly lying to maintain that denial. You can't accept what your country has become.

I have covered and exposed your lies, but I've given you enough opportunities now to stop lying. Goodbye.

There is only one reason they first starved, then fed them this, and then made sure for them to know what they had eaten. Cruelty. Of a kind you cannot imagine."

The people who actually concoct such torture are a rare breed and they do NOT do it for any religious reasons. It’s simply their singular obsession to enact pain on others. Think about the worst serial killers you have ever heard of. Now, give them a position of power over any human.

And the Christian pastors here got on about how it's okay if a woman gets raped because she should have been acting like a paranoid schizophrenic (my words, not his) and pretending that every man on earth was on a mission to rape her -- and since she didn't, giving one an opportunity to rape her by being alone with him, then it's her fault and not the rapist's fault. Back in my day, the kind of people who couldn't be trusted with women were called heathens and deserved to be hanged, but I guess that's not PC. As long as it was another white man, pastor boy thought being a heathen was acceptable -- even expectable!!! 👹


He was forced to apologize... after it made the news and EVERYONE outside of the church got absolutely appalled and said, ""That's the ""Christian"" moral? That if you can get a woman alone then rape is okay? You believe your Jesus tells you that?!"" Then he made the church look bad to outsiders and they stopped him, but they kept him for years before that and no doubt he was awful all along!


Imagine your mom trusts one of your friends because he's your friend and lets him hang out at the house when you're not there expecting you to come home, and instead he rapes her, leaves, and no one wants to punish him because it's her responsibility to assume all men are rapists instead of his responsibility to not rape people. 😲


Are they going to give you leniency for ending his life the way they're trying to give him leniency for raping her? No? The law protects rapists already, and it's all the Christians' fault. They make excuses and blame women for everything. You don't think that's why he can get away with it but they yammer and bitch about ""consequences"" and ""shouldn't have opened your legs"" when a woman has sex that ISN'T rape?

And she received an unspeakably cruel threat. “She had given birth 15 days before she was captured, and they said to her: ‘We will kill your baby and force you to eat his flesh',” Amira says.

Source: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cervj8v7g91o

> “Afterwards, they brought her a plate of rice and meat. She ate the food because she was very hungry.

letsgetawayfromhere,programming_student2,"Yazidis follow a different religion, which is neither Muslim, nor even of the book. The book religions Christianity and Judaism get a special status in Islam, because they believe in the same god, although they do not recognize Mohamed as a prophet. People who believe in any other religions are heathens and basically you can do with them as you please. 

On top of that, ISIS is famous for treating anyone as a full-on heathen who does not share their own special flair of Islamic faith. Now imagine how they treat a ""true"" heathen... here you go. 

To justify something like that, you must be quite far gone and probably never were a decent person to begin with. This story speaks of incredible sadism, disdain for human beings and a devilish delight in the destruction of the souls and minds of ""other"" people. You can see evil persons like this commiting crimes all over the world, but usually they are on their own when they torture and kill. 

IMO this is the closest to demonic evil as a baseline in a political group that the world has seen since the days of Pol Pot (Edit: I forgot about the Mexican cartels, they also belong here).

But the depths of human depravity are one of the main reasons I am simply not a believer. What kind of a god would let this happen.

Portion of the transcript [from the episode:](https://teamcoco.com/podcasts/conan-obrien-needs-a-friend/episodes/amir-from-iran)

>Amir: You know Conan, you talked about my personal experience growing up here. So I remember being in elementary school and they, we had Koran classes, Koran, the, the book that Muslims read. You know about that, right?

>Conan: Yes, of course.

>Amir: The Koran.

>Conan: Yes.

>Amir: And so, we had classes of Koran and they would tell us, the whole premise of the class was just read Koran and read Koran, you know, musically read it, learn to read Koran the right way.
And I was like, well wait a minute. So I'm reading Koran, but I'm not reading the translation. I'm just reading in Arabic, like how insane is that? Reading the Koran in Arabic, not reading it in Persian, not not reading what it says. And that's why people would say like, well, are the protestors protesting Islam? I was like, Look.
The, our problem isn't with Islam. I just don't want Islam ruling my life.

>Conan: Right, Right.

>Amir: I don't want Muslims, it’s not even Islam, like there mullahs here that haven't read Koran. They just make stuff up. They just make stuff up. They haven't even read Koran, this mandatory hijab. It's not in Koran. Muslims will tell you, it's not in Koran.
They do a lot of stuff that's not in Koran, but since people don't read Koran here, they just have to sing it perfectly.

>Conan: Yeah.

>Amir: Like it, it's crazy. Imagine if people will like, look, you're gonna have to read, uh, the script, but in Arabic and don't understand anything.

>Conan: Right.

>Amir: Just read in Arabic. It's insane. It's just, you know, pure, um, hypnotizing us.

>Conan: Yeah.

>Sona: It's indoctrination.

>Amir: The history book here is not the real history. And by the way, I urge you guys to share this knowledge, share this to everybody. It's what we want most. I heard, I saw a post on Instagram, people said, Yes, celebrities are, are talking about Iran for attention.
Yes, we want attention. Talk. I don't care if you're a narcissist or you're just a down to earth guy. Post about Iran. People need to know about us.

Also she said that this was after a forced march, and it's normal to get stomach issues when you first eat after a few days like that. It's probably more likely they just fed them whatever scraps they had around and told them it was baby meat as a form of torture. And meat that tastes weird and causes indigestion is probably due to being old rather than human."

And how many of those ""accounts"" are from people who were fed the meat of babies prepared by a terrorist organization? Just out of curiosity. I would think that could affect the flavor and sanitary nature of any meal, given that hostage health is not the top concern of these groups.

""Babies have little meat on them"" lmao do you think they killed children based on the amount of edible meat? For some reason I struggle to believe that was a primary motivating factor when killing babies. You bringing that up is what fails to make sense in my opinion"

There are no verified or credible reports of ISIS releasing recordings specifically showing fetuses being cut from women’s bodies. While ISIS committed numerous atrocities, including severe violence against women, many of the most shocking claims—such as those involving gruesome acts like cutting fetuses from women's bodies—are often exaggerated or based on unverified reports. Such extreme allegations can circulate as part of psychological warfare, rumors, or propaganda, but credible human rights organizations and reputable media outlets tend to report verified information based on thorough investigations."

Doesn't mean that I want them excused for any atrocities they did either though, ''I just followed orders'' is not a valid excuse at the end of they day, much the same as ''I just followed my religious doctrines'' isn't a good enough reason. 

There is a lot of people who has caused a lot of harm for the ''greater good'' without being religious. Just like there is a lot of religious people that has done a lot of good. People are just people at the end of the day, and it is people who make up the religion. Any evil done in the name of a religion is done by the people who practices it.

You’re the one minimizing and cherry picking to suit your own John Lennon inspired world view. Your taking  a stance that is identical to the “plagues” you refer too. If a religious person says “ all non theists are evil” you would cry and stomp your feet. But somehow it’s ok for non theists to say “ all religious people are evil”? No, that’s not how the world works. You’re as bad and rotted as the people who pick and choose bible verses to suit their own needs, while ignoring the ones that are inconvenient to their world view. Now climb down off your soapbox, I’m sure we could use the wood."
Falsus,MaxRD,"And my entire point was that you don't *need* religion for any atrocities. Extremists can use other excuses if it suits them if Religion isn't at hand. 

And you even corroborate my entire point with that reply, it isn't about religion itself at all, it is about having control and using it to mess up other people. Remove religion in the equation it will be replaced with something else. 

Religion isn't some grand, supernatural behemoth. It is made up by people, it is propagated by people and if people acts in the name of the religion it is still acts by people, not god. It is people who chose to do these things, blaming it on religion rather than on the people themselves just diminishes this. 

At the end of the day religion is just another social concept that has been invented and shared by people for thousands of years, which has lead to both bad and good things. Like the pastor who invented the first suicide hotline and worked hard to increase sex ed in schools ,after officiating the burial of a girl who killed herself after she got her first period and thought she had a STD and was unclean. 

At the end of the day, it is people who should answer for the atrocities they do. Removing religion wouldn't remove the atrocities."

Just because the people who aren't ISIS are using propaganda, doesn't somehow make it good propaganda. It's not good that they're relying on propaganda to tell you that ISIS is bad when there are verifiable horrors. 

It's a way to justify other people's horrific actions because, hey, they're not as bad as ISIS.

michaelkiss,thecheekymonkey,"Other Quranist here.

As a Quranist Muslim, my practice of Islam focuses solely on the Quran as the ultimate source of guidance. This sets me apart from traditional Muslims, who rely on both the Quran and the Hadith (sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad) to shape their beliefs and practices.

One key difference lies in how I perform prayer (Salat). While traditional Muslims follow detailed rituals from the Hadith for five daily prayers, I rely solely on the Quran’s guidance. My prayer times and actions—such as standing, bowing, and prostrating—are based on the instructions I find in the Quran, without incorporating the extra details from Hadith.

Another difference is in the Shahada, the declaration of faith. Traditional Muslims include “Muhammad is the messenger of God” in their Shahada, but as a Quranist, I focus exclusively on the unity of God, as the Quran emphasizes monotheism. This doesn’t diminish my respect for the Prophet, but I believe the Quran alone is sufficient for guidance.

When it comes to dietary laws, I strictly follow what is outlined in the Quran, such as avoiding pork and carrion. Traditional Muslims may follow additional restrictions from the Hadith, but I believe the Quran clearly defines what is permissible and forbidden.

Regarding the Prophet, I honor Muhammad as the final messenger, but I don’t model my daily life on Hadith-based accounts of his actions. Traditional Muslims often turn to the Hadith for detailed examples of how the Prophet lived, but I believe following the Quran is what God asks of me.

Finally, my view of the Hadith is another significant distinction. While traditional Muslims consider Hadith essential for understanding Islam, I view the Quran as the only divinely preserved and necessary source. I don’t reject Hadith outright, but I don’t consider it binding or authoritative in my faith.

In essence, my practice of Islam is centered entirely on the Quran, while traditional Muslims incorporate a broader range of sources, including Hadith, to guide their religious lives."

michaelkiss,jp299,"As a Quranist, I find it challenging to speak on behalf of others since there’s a wide range of individual interpretations. However, I can explain my own understanding. Quranism is a minority approach, and while it’s not an ancient tradition, it has been around for several centuries. Quranists rely solely on the Quran for guidance, without using Hadiths or other texts, which sets us apart from Sunni and Shia Muslims. This approach can sometimes draw criticism from both Sunni and Shia communities, as they consider Hadith an essential part of Islamic practice.

Despite this, I’ve witnessed in fellow Quranists a strong commitment to values such as peaceful coexistence, respect for diversity, and religious freedom. These qualities resonate with me and are central to why I identify as a Quranist. While it might seem similar to a “Protestant” approach in Islam due to its emphasis on individual interpretation, the goal for many of us is to live according to the Quran’s message, fostering understanding and respect for all."
michaelkiss,brus_wein,"As a convert to Islam, I wasn’t raised with a Sunni or Shia background, so my understanding of Islam has been shaped primarily by the Quran. From what I’ve learned, Islam is meant to be easy and straightforward, as the Quran itself teaches.

I hold the Quran to be the holy and complete word of God, but I’m cautious about the hadith because many were compiled much later, and some are likely fabricated. The Quran says it is complete and fully detailed (6:114, 16:89), so I focus on what’s clearly from God. I don’t reject the Prophet’s teachings, but I am careful not to follow anything that might contradict the Quran or add unnecessary complications.

Yes, some might call me an innovator, but by the same measure, I could say that adding teachings outside of the Quran is also an innovation. For me, staying true to the Quran is the core of my practice."

MartijnProper,Majestic_Mammoth729,">""extremely belittling and arrogant which is a stereotype that non-religious people have to fight against constantly""

To be honest, I never had to fight against that. And I really do feel that someone following a religion should follow their holy book(s), Abrahamic or otherwise, and should not listen to what other humans say they should do, but understand the book for themselves and act like it. It works like that in physics, too. I can tell you what centrifugal energy is, but being in a centrifuge is something different.

How am I on a pedestal? Am I better for being agnostic? I'm not sure... (yes that was a joke) No I'm not, some guy follows rules from a silly book, but the rules are good and so is the guy, probably. We can have a coffee and chat, even if we don't agree on the details. We're the same, but different.

How am I arrogant? Is my point of view better than his, or yours? No, it's not, it's different, and if we can respect each other's opinions, fucking kumbaya, mate.
